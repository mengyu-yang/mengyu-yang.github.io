About Me
======
I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, in the [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/about_engsci/) program specializing in [Machine Intelligence](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/majors/machine-intelligence/). I'm also passionate about research at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. In other words, I like to build intelligent systems that interact with and reason about out multisensory world, with a focus on vision and audio. 

During my summers and alongside my studies, I've had the pleasure of working at the [Dynamic Graphics Project](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/) lab, the [BMO Lab for Creative Research](https://bmolab.artsci.utoronto.ca/), and am currently at the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).
