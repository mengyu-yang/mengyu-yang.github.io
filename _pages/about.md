About Me
======
I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto in the [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/about_engsci/) program specializing in [Machine Intelligence](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/majors/machine-intelligence/). I'm also passionate about research at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. In other words, I like to build intelligent systems that interact with and reason about out multimodal world, with a focus on vision and audio. 

During my summers and alongside my studies, I've had the pleasure of working at the [Dynamic Graphics Project](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/) lab with [Khai N. Truong](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~khai/) and [Tovi Grossman](https://www.tovigrossman.com/); I'm thankful to [Jonathan Rose](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jayar/) for introducing me to the [BMO Lab for Creative Research](https://bmolab.artsci.utoronto.ca/), where I worked with [David Rokeby](https://www.cdtps.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/david-rokeby) and [Xavier Snelgrove](https://wxs.ca/); and I am currently at the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) working with [Sageev Oore](https://www.cs.smu.ca/~sageev/).

Teaching 
======
After taking these courses myself during first year, I developed a strong interest in engineering design. It incorporates ideas and skills that can be applied to many fields. Also, understanding its fundamentals made me cognizant of how much it's incorporated into everyday things.  

**ESC101: Praxis I | University of Toronto**   
Fall 2019, Peer Assistant TA  
<ins>Course Description:</ins>   
- Praxis I introduces students to a rigourous foundation of engineering design theory. It teaches and evaluates students on aspects such as communication, teamwork, research, and prototyping. The latter half of the course gets teams of students to design and prototype a product that improves the lived experience of a community within campus.  
<a/>

<ins>Activities:</ins>   
* Graded Core Competency quizzes evaluating students' abilities on fundamental engineering design skills such as research, argumentation, and comprehension of design requirements. 
* Listened to team "Alpha" presentations (semi-structured discussions on project progress and design approaches used) and suggested feedback and future directions.
* Listened to "Crit" presentations (formal presentation where teams explain their methodology and present a recommended design) and offered constructive feedback.


**ESC102: Praxis II [(Link)](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/esc102showcase/) | University of Toronto**     
Winter 2020, Peer Assistant TA   
<ins>Course Description:</ins>  
* A continuation of Praxis I, Praxis II consists of a semester-long design project where student groups approach and work with a community of their choice within the Greater Toronto Area. Over the course of this project, students are exposed to the entire engineering design process, starting from visiting potential communities to writing a Request for Proposal on an identified opportunity, iteratively refining and prototyping a design, and finally presenting and defending their work in a Showcase that is open to the general public. 
<a/>

<ins>Activities:</ins>     
* Held group sessions on how to approach potential communities to work with through cold calling. 
* Graded field note reports detailing students' initial assessments of their chosen community after visiting.  
* Held tutorial sessions to support students with their semester-long design projects.  

More About Me 
======
* I've been playing classical piano since I was 5. During my Grade 12 year, I had the pleasure of learning with [Valerie Tryon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie_Tryon). I'm also passionate about all other kinds of music as well! Here are some of my favourites from [jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaAiNL-YJIs), [contemporary classical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzI3QFz01Ds), [opera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjMwDbFng_g), [indie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MNEEGgFsKw), [pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BvRgwUisSg), and [R&B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_hT61-E5kg).  
* I practiced Taekwondo since I was 6, although I've taken a break from it since starting university. I was a 2nd degree black belt by then. Here's a (very old) [clip]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/taekwondo.gif) of me when I was 13 breaking some boards. 
* I'm a huge fan of coffee ☕. But honestly, who isn't? Favourite drink: Americano 
* This is my dog, [Jill]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jill.jpg), although she mostly responds to 吉儿. She's a Chihuahua.
