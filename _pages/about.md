I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, in the [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/about_engsci/) program specializing in [Machine Intelligence](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/majors/machine-intelligence/). I'm also passionate about research at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. In other words, I like to build intelligent systems that interact with and reason about out multisensory world, with a focus on vision and audio.
